Included in this git are a variety of projects I have created during my time as a Computer Science Student.
PolyLinkedList allows for the addition, subtraction, exponent, multiplaction, and modulus functions of polynomials implemented as linked lists.
AVLVector implements the functionality of a vector, albeit in O(log n) time. This is done by creating an AVL tree sorted by rank without the inclusion of an internal rank factor.
