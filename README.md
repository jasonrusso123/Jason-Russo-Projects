Included in this git are a variety of projects I have created during my time as a Computer Science Student.
PolyLinkedList allows for the addition, subtraction, exponent, multiplaction, and modulus functions of polynomials implemented as linked lists.
AVLVector implements the functionality of a vector, albeit in O(log n) time. This is done by creating an AVL tree sorted by rank without the inclusion of an internal rank factor.
Finally, BPTree implements a B+-tree, albeit without pointers. Insert, delete, and search work exactly as in a typical B+-tree, the only difference being the use of a 2-dimensional array of characters rather than typical nodes with pointers.
