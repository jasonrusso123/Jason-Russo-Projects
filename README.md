Included in this repository are a variety of projects I have implemented during my time as a Computer Science Student.
PolyLinkedList allows for the addition, subtraction, exponent, multiplication, evaluation, and modulus functions of polynomials implemented as linked lists. These functions operate in O(n), O(n), O(n^2logn), O(n^2), O(n), and O(n^2), respectively.
AVLVector implements the functionality of a vector, albeit in O(log n) time. This is done by creating an AVL tree sorted by rank without the inclusion of an internal rank factor. The functions included are insert, delete, rank-of, and search.
